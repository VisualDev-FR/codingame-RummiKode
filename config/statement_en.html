      <span>The Goal</span>
    </h1>
    <div class="statement-goal-content">
      The goal is to throw all your your cards by making differents types of stacks :
      <br>
      <ul>
        <li>the color stacks : minimum of 3 cards with the same number and differrent colors </li>
        <li>the series stacks : minimum of 3 cards with the same colors and consecutive numbers.</li>
      </ul>
      There is a total amount of 104 cards in the game with 4 differents colors (<strong>BLACK</strong>, <strong>BLUE</strong>, <strong>GREEN</strong>, <strong>YELLOW</strong>) and 13 numbers from <strong>0 to 12</strong>. Each card is present two times. 104 = 2 x (4 x 13)

      <span>Rules</span>
    </h1>
    <div>
      <div class="statement-rules-content">
        Your program receives differents inputs representing the game state. Any possible action will be given to you.<br>
        <br>
        You have two ways to throw your cards :
        <br>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>PUSH</strong> a new stack in the game, if the cards in your hand allow you to do it</li>
          <li><strong>ADD</strong> a card in a stack wich has already been pushed in the game (you are not allowed to do that, before you pushed at least one stack)</li>
        </ul>        
        To throw all your cards and once you have pushed at least one stack, you have the possibility to play differents actions :
        <ul>
          <li><strong>TAKE</strong> a card in a stack, if the concerned stack still have at least 3 cards after taking it. This action may split a stack if the card is not on one of the two bounds. In this case, you have to ensure that the both stacks have at least 3 cards.</li>
          <li><strong>MOVE</strong> a card from a stack to another. As the TAKE action, you have to ensure that the stack where the card is taken still contains at least three cards after the move action, moreover you have to ensure that you're allowed to move the card in the destination stack.</li>
          <li><strong>SPLIT</strong> a stack, for that you have to ensure that the both side of the stack counts at least 3 cards (this is why you cannot split a color stack)</li>
          <li><strong>JOIN</strong> two stacks, i they have consecutive numbers, it can allows you to take a card which couldn't be takable before</li>
          <li><strong>WAIT</strong> it can allow you to draw a card in the common draw if you did not throw any card during your game turn. But if you throwed at least one card during your game turn, you won't have the possibility to draw a card and you will only wait for your next game turn. It can allow you to preserve some cards in order to make bigger stacks to push.</li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        Here is the exhaustive list of rules :
        <ul>
          <li>All players start with <strong>14</strong> cards in their hand</li>
          <li>At the begining of the game, you must push a stack in the game, to have to possibility to play other actions</li>
          <li>You can play <strong>5</strong> actions before pushing or adding, and you'll be able to <Strong>PUSH</Strong> and <strong>ADD</strong> while your cards allow it to you. At each turn, your actions count will be reset to <strong>5</strong>, you cannot acummulate actions from a turn to another.</li>
          <li>If you don't throw any card in your game turn, you will have to draw one card in the common draw. If it is empty you will not draw any card.</li>
          <li>The first player who did throw all his cards wins, and end the game</li>
          <li>Then, the ranking system works as follow :</li>
            <ul>
              <li>Your ranking depends of the amount of cards you have at the end of the game.</li>
              <li>The less you will have cards in hand, the best will be your rank</li>
              <li>If you have the same amount of cards than other players, the tie will be broken with the total amount of actions you played in the game</li>
              <li>In this case, the players with the less amount of actions played will have a better rank. <Strong>Every</Strong> action are counted, exepted the <Strong>PUSH</Strong> and the <strong>ADD</strong>.</li>
            </ul>
          
        </ul>
        You <strong>lose</strong> if:
        <ul>
          <li>You do not supply a valid action / an action in due time.</li>
          <li>You try to insert a card in a stack wich cannot contain this card.</li>
          <li>You try to remove a card wich cannot be removed from the concerned stack.</li>
          <li>You try to push an invalid stack (watch out to avoid to push two identical cards in the same stack)</li>
          <li>You try to play an action with an actions left count equals to 0</li>
        </ul>
