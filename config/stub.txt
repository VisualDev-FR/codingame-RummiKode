myPlayerIndex: the index of your player
playersCount: the total amount of players
stacksCount: the amount of stacks pushed in the game
playerIndex: the index of the current player

ADD <stackID> <cardCode>
PUSH <cardCode1>, <cardCode2>...
SPLIT <stackID> <cardCode_1> <cardCode_2>
JOIN <stackID_1> <stackID_2>
MOVE <stackID_From> <stackID_To> <cardCodeFrom>
