The goal is to throw all your your cards by making differents types of stacks :
- the color stacks : minimum of 3 cards with the same number and differrent colors
- the series stacks : minimum of 3 cards with the same colors and consecutive numbers.

you have two ways to throw your cards :
- by pushing a new stack in the game, if the cards in your hand allows you to do it
- by adding a card in a stack wich has already been pushed in the game (you are not allowed to do that, before you pushed at least one stack)

To throw all your cards, you have the possibility to play differents actions :
- Taking a card in a stack, if the stack still have at least 3 cards after taking it
- Moving a card from a stack to another 
- Spliting a stack, for that you have to ensure that the both side of the stack counts at least 3 cards (this is why you cannot split a color stack)
- Merging a stack, if two stacks have consecutive numbers, it can allows you to take a card which couldn't be takable before


here is a non-exhaustive rules list :
- both players start with 14 cards in their hand
- the first player who did throw all his cards win
- if, after 200 turns, all players have still at least one card, the player with the fewest cards win
- at the begining of the game, you must push a stack in the game, to have to possibility to play other actions
- you cannot make a stack which contains two identical cards
- you can play 5 actions before pushing or adding, and you'll be able to push and add while your cards allows you (it means that if the random draw gives a perfect game, the first player could finish without letting play the second player)
- the rest will come with the statements :)

I think the biggest part of the "game engine" is done, but i still have a lot of work :
- debbuging / testing all game actions
- coding the entire game viewer
- write the statements
- testing
- debugging
- coding
- testing
- ...

and this is some gameplay points where your points of view could be intersting for me
- I'm hesitating to give all players's cards to everyone, i think it could make the game more "agressive"
- I'm looking for a best way to distribute the number of play actions to the players, instead of giving only 5 actions

I'm listening about any improvement / creative idea so don't hesitate, and thanks in advance for your feedbacks ! :)
